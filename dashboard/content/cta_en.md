Ready to take the next steps? You can start by using the software as it stands to explore local energy scenarios and deepen your understanding of energy self-sufficiency. The toolkit is ready to be put to work in your specific context, providing valuable insights through its built-in models and visualizations.

If youâ€™re interested in going further, consider building on top of the toolkit. The framework is designed to be extensible, allowing technically inclined users to modify the existing models or create new scenarios tailored to their needs. The open nature of the project encourages customization and innovation.

We also welcome collaboration. Whether you have ideas for improving the toolkit, developing new features, or integrating it into other tools, your contributions are valuable. Working together, we can refine and expand the toolkit to better serve a wider range of users.

Finally, if you want to contribute to the ongoing development, we invite you to get involved. The Energy Toolkit grows through successive projects and we would be happy to take the next steps with your project.
