The Energy Toolkit is designed to spread and deepen an understanding of the possibilities in local energy production and energy self-sufficiency. It serves as a comprehensive resource for those interested in exploring and optimizing power systems at a local level.

### Components of The Energy Toolkit:
1. **A framework for power system optimization and analysis using [PyPSA](https://pypsa.org/):**
   - PyPSA is a powerful tool for simulating and optimizing energy systems, making it possible to analyze various scenarios of power generation and consumption.
2. **A generator for running large numbers of scenarios:**
   - This feature enables the exploration of multiple energy scenarios, allowing users to assess different configurations and their outcomes.
3. **An API for accessing the resulting data:**
   - The API provides access to the data generated by the scenarios, enabling further analysis or integration into other tools.
4. **An app for visualizing the results (based on Streamlit):**
   - The Streamlit-based app makes it easy to visualize the data and outcomes from the simulations, providing an intuitive interface for exploring results.

## Use Cases

The Energy Toolkit can be used by regional and local stakeholders with an interest in or responsibilities for energy, as well as by industry and the general public. The visual interface is designed to be broadly accessible, catering to anyone with a basic understanding of electricity generation.

For more technically inclined users, the underlying power model and scenario generator can be modified. This allows for the customization of the model and the execution of scenarios that reflect the specific conditions of different localities, enabling in-depth analysis and tailored insights.

## Assumptions

All parts of the model are open-source, and the full code of the project is accessible [https://github.com/viktorbengtsson/pypsa-vgr](https://github.com/viktorbengtsson/pypsa-vgr). The assumptions underlying the model are also openly accessible. For clarity, we display them all below.
